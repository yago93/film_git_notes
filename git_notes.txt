add     also used to stage a changed file ready for "commit"

                git checkout <filename> to discard the nonstaged changes                                 C-x v   u (ignore: Yes)
		git diff   to see the changes                                                            C-x v   =

Push to a remote repository
___________________________

First, create a new repository in https://github.com/yago93/  named film_git_notes.git
Then following the instructions of the site push the local repository to the remote one

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yago93/film_git_notes.git
$ git push -u origin master

This last command asks for username and password and transfers local information to the remote server.

(Still do not know whether this can be done from inside Emacs)
